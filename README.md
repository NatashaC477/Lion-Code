#### Why LionCode?
Once upon a time on the Bluff, Iggy the Lion faced a monumental challenge when he realized that none of the existing programming languages truly honored the Jesuit values he held dear. Driven by a desire to integrate service, justice, and the pursuit of knowledge into every line of code, Iggy decided to create his own language‚ÄîLion Code. 

Iggy wove a strand of the Jesuit spirit into LionCode, determined that it would not only help others write effective programs but also inspire them to approach technology with a heart rooted in empathy and a commitment to serving the greater good.
